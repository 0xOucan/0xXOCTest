## 🌟 Overview

0xXOC is a peer-to-peer marketplace platform that bridges the gap between Mexican Pesos (MXN) and cryptocurrencies through seamless integration with OXXO Spin QR codes. By leveraging Mexico's most accessible payment method, we're making crypto accessible to everyone in Mexico - regardless of technical expertise or banking status.

As a Base Batch LatAm hackathon project, 0xXOC focuses on providing a practical solution for remittances and cross-border payments using Base network's stablecoins (USDC, MXNe, XOC), enabling people in the US to easily send money to relatives in Mexico.

## 🇲🇽 Problem Statement

In Mexico, many people face significant barriers when trying to access cryptocurrency:

- **Complex KYC Processes**: Traditional crypto exchanges require extensive verification procedures
- **Technical Barriers**: Many platforms assume technical knowledge that average users don't possess
- **Banking Limitations**: Not all Mexicans have access to bank accounts or credit cards required by exchanges
- **Trust Issues**: Concerns about security and fraud prevent many from exploring crypto options
- **Remittance Challenges**: US-to-Mexico remittances often involve high fees and slow settlement times

Meanwhile, OXXO stores are ubiquitous in Mexico (19,000+ locations), and the OXXO Spin app has become a widely adopted payment method with a simplified KYC process that millions of Mexicans already use daily.

## 💡 Solution

0xXOC connects these two worlds by building a bridge between OXXO Spin QR codes and cryptocurrency:

1. **Simplified Access**: Users can buy crypto using OXXO Spin QR codes they're already familiar with
2. **Trusted Environment**: The platform uses a secure escrow system to protect both buyers and sellers
3. **Local Integration**: Designed specifically for the Mexican market and local payment methods
4. **No Technical Barriers**: User-friendly interface with straightforward buying and selling processes
5. **Direct P2P Trading**: Connects buyers and sellers directly without centralized exchange fees
6. **Efficient Remittances**: People in the US can send stablecoins (USDC, MXNe) that are redeemable for Mexican Pesos

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- npm v7+
- A browser extension wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) connected to Base network

### Installation

```bash
# Clone both repositories
git clone https://github.com/0xOucan/0xXOC-AIP2PMXNExchange.git
cd 0xXOC-AIP2PMXNExchange

# Use the launch script to start both services
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
```

The launch script automatically:
1. Installs dependencies for both repositories
2. Starts the backend API server
3. Starts the frontend development server
4. Connects them together with proper configuration

### Environment Setup

Required in your `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here  # Only for escrow wallet operations
ESCROW_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_escrow_private_key_here  # Optional

# For frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_BASE_EXPLORER_URL=https://basescan.org
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
VITE_ESCROW_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x9c77c6fafc1eb0821F1De12972Ef0199C97C6e45
```

> **Security Note**: Private keys are only required for the backend escrow operations. Users connect using browser extension wallets without exposing private keys.

## 🛒 Marketplace Features

0xXOC implements a comprehensive P2P marketplace system:

### Order Types

1. **Buying Orders**:
   - User provides an OXXO Spin QR code with MXN amount
   - Specifies which token and amount they want to buy
   - QR code is encrypted and stored securely
   - Sellers can fill the order by transferring tokens

2. **Selling Orders**:
   - User escrows tokens they want to sell
   - Specifies the MXN amount they want to receive
   - Buyers can fill the order with an OXXO Spin QR code
   - Once verified, tokens are released to the buyer

### Escrow System

The 0xXOC marketplace uses a secure escrow system to protect all trades:
- Tokens are held in escrow during the trading process
- Escrow is controlled by smart contracts and verified by Coinbase Agent Kit
- All transactions are recorded on-chain for full transparency
- Escrow is only released when all conditions are met
